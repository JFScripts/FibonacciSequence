Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This is a simple C program that generates the first terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

📌 About the Program

The code implements the Fibonacci sequence using unsigned long long int variables to avoid overflow and allow large numbers. It prints the sequence starting at 0 and 1, calculating the next terms by summing the previous two.

🖥️ How to Run

Compile the code:

gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci

Run the program:

./fibonacci

🔢 Example Output

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
...

🛠 Possible Improvements

Implement support for larger numbers using libraries like GMP.

Add an option for the user to choose how many terms to calculate.

Improve efficiency with memory optimizations.
